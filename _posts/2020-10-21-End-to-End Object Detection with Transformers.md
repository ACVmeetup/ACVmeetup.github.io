21.10.2020 we read and discuss   
"End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers" 
by Nicolas Carion, Francisco Massa, Gabriel Synnaeve, Nicolas Usunier, Alexander Kirillov, Sergey Zagoruyko

That is going to be our first online meetup.

As a warm up we briefly discuss Transformer architecture from
