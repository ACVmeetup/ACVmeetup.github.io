Here are some ideas we have thought it will be fun to try. Some ideas could be good, some others bad, some very hard and others could turn out to be easy. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯



We are trying to meet some weekends and just code for fun. It is all about learning 



* Implement a mask using only the gradients to propagate depth training signal and use a shader to generate a dense depth map as in "Image based rendering in the Gradient Domain". This is interesting because gradients deal with reflections and textureless areas naturally.

* Implement a classical SfM approach using graph cuts to generate dense depth as in "Multi-camera Scene Reconstruction via Graph Cuts".

  

Bye!
