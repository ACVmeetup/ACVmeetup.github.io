title: About the meetup
---

We organize a meetup dedicated to computer vision in Berlin.
We focus on the state-of-the-art papers and algorithms.

Slack channel: `#study-group` at [autonom-mobility.slack.com](https://autonom-mobility.slack.com/) 


* This is not an introductory talk or one-way conversation, there is no speaker.
* Everyone is expected to talk
* Everyone is expected to have few points/questions that he/she would like to talk about
* Every assistant should be able to understand the paper and should have already read the paper
* The meeting is not to read the paper but to discuss about the questions and ideas about it
* Only come if you consider you can contribute something to the conversation 
  (in the form of interesting questions, CV knowledge, understanding of ML, etc. etc.), 
  you donâ€™t have to be expert in the topic we are discussing but you should have some experience 
  in related areas at least.
* [[suggestion]] the event has a cap of 10 people and a fee of 3 eur to avoid people signing in and not going (we can get coffee/crackers/bread/etc. with that money)
* The length of the meeting should be around 2-3h
* We have a quick intro of all people in the table before start discussing
* The point of this discussion-group is to go have an active conversation in person about papers in CV and Deep Learning (one paper each session), we are going to with a  focus on depth estimation models and the idea is to share ideas, questions, doubts regarding the paper in each session. The goal is to start the conversation from a fair understanding of the paper (i.e. previous careful reading of the paper) and move together towards deep understanding of the paper and the topic (i.e. its equations, details, etc. etc)
