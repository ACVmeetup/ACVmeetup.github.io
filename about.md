We organize a meetup dedicated to computer vision in Berlin.
We focus on the state-of-the-art papers and algorithms.

The point of this discussion group is to have an active discussion about papers related to CV and Deep Learning. The goal is to start the conversation from a fair understanding of the paper (i.e. previous careful reading of the paper) and move together towards a deep understanding of the paper and the topic (i.e. its equations, details, etc. etc) by sharing ideas, questions, doubts.



Here are some basic rules:

1. This is not an introductory talk and there is no speaker.
2. Everyone is expected to talk.
3. Everyone is expected to have a few points/questions that he/she would like to discuss.
4. Every assistant should be able to understand the paper and should have *carefully* read the paper before the meeting in his/her own time.
5. The meeting is not to read the paper but to discuss the questions/doubts/ideas about it.
6. Only come if you consider you can contribute something to the conversation (in the form of interesting questions, CV knowledge, understanding of ML, etc. etc.), you donâ€™t have to be expert in the topic we are discussing but you should have some experience in related areas at least.
7. Only RSVP if you are *100% sure* you are going to assist. Places are scare and you will be taking it from someone else.
