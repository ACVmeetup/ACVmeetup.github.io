The objective of this meetup is to meet and discuss CV papers, mainly in the area of ML but sometimes (not always) and
interesting off-topic ML paper is welcome. The goal is to start the conversation from a fair understanding of the
paper (i.e. previous careful reading of the paper) and move together towards a deep understanding of the paper and the
topic (i.e. its equations, details, etc. etc) by sharing ideas, questions, doubts.

There are few rules we follow:

* Please read the paper before the meetup

* The meeting is not to read the paper but to discuss it.
